I am a Ph.D. candidate in Business Economics at Harvard University. My research sits at the intersection of industrial organization and digital markets, focusing on how data-driven technologies, firm strategies, and public policy interact to shape market outcomes. In my job market paper, I develop a reinforcement learning algorithm to estimate a dynamic entry and investment game in U.S. broadband, quantifying the impact of infrastructure regulation on competition and investment in a networked market.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I received my B.S. in mathematics with computer science and in economics from MIT.

I am on the 2025-2026 academic job market. You can find my job market paper [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IuxGOfyKjbDcl8eF48BrByPT3lgdMlUY/view?usp=sharing) and my CV [here](https://jen-zou.github.io/cv/). I can be reached at [jzou@g.harvard.edu](mailto:jzou@g.harvard.edu).
